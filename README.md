# Understanding_GAN

Generative Adversial Networks is a tough little conecpt to understand in Deep Learning as it involves two different working models, (a constructor and a generator) to work simultaneously while comoaring the answers of each other using BCE Loss. To explain the whole process and how it works, I have created this repository. It consists of one code file where everything you need to know about GANS is present. A little past knowledge about BCELoss and CNN function is needed.
